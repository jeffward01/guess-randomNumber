# guess-randomNumber
This is a basic game where the user guesses a randomly generated number by the computer

<--File Info-->
All project files are located in the 'Project' Folder.

This is a game that takes 2 input numbers generated from the user, and then the computer generates a random number (Which can be revielied if the user chooses).
Then the user has to guess the random number, and then later can see how many 'guesses' it took the user to guess the random number.
